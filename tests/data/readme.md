M1 is the initial cross-section built from the 3D subsurface model of the lower Var valley presented in:

Rohmer, O., Bertrand, E., Mercerat, E., Régnier, J., Pernoud, M., Langlaude, P., & Alvarez, M., 2020. Combining borehole log-stratigraphies and ambient vibration data to build a 3D model of the Lower Var Valley, Nice (France), Engineering Geology, 270, 105588.

The authors would like to thank Etienne Bertrand, Diego Mercerat and Ophélie Rohmer building and providing the 2D data used in this study.
